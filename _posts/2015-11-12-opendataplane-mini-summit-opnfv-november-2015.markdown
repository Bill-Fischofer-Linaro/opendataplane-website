#### The OpenDataPlane project hosts a mini-summit at the OPNFV Summit in Burlingame, CA November 2015.

The November 2015 ODP mini Summit [1] was a great success and was co-located with the inaugural OPNFV summit in the Bay Area. The event was enthusiastically attended with a presentation from Linaro providing an overview of ODP [5] followed by deeper observations from Broadcom [7], Cavium [2], Huawei [6], Freescale [8] and EZchip [9]. Each presenter outlined their experiences with ODP and how it relates to their business and vision for the future of accelerated networking.

A fast datapath is not as valuable until there is an IP stack to connect it to applications and ENEA presented a first look at a nascent open source userspace stack called OpenFastPath [3] that runs on ODP.

The afternoon demonstrations [4] session provided an opportunity to talk centering on five different SoC configurations all running ODP from Cavium, Huawei, Broadcom and Freescale. The demos themselves  encompassing IPSEC, Crypto offload, OpenvSwitch and the general performance ODP.
