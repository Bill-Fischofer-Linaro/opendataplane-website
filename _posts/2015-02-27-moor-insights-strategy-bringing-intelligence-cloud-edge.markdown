[Moor](http://www.moorinsightsstrategy.com/) Insight & Strategy [article](http://www.moorinsightsstrategy.com/research-brief-bringing-intelligence-to-the-cloud-edge/) & [paper](http://www.moorinsightsstrategy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Bringing-Intelligence-To-Cloud-Edge-by-Moor-Insights-and-Strategy.pdf) quotes the benefits of OpenDataPlane as a framework for increasing compute efficiency.


<blockquote markdown="1">
A truly flexible cloud platform needs to support flexible and open enabling software layers like KVM, **OpenDataPlane**, OpenDayLight, OpenStack, and Open vSwitch.

_Support for **OpenDataPlane**, OpnNFV, and OpenFlow will be critical, as well as the flexibility to support other open protocols that emerge_

An excerpt from the Moor article:


<blockquote markdown="1">
**Executive Summary**
The telecommunications industry is moving to cloud-based technologies at the network edge to help tackle the explosion of mobile video consumption, service mobility, virtualization of Customer-Premise Equipment (CPE), the Internet of Things (IoT), and other latency-sensitive applications. But unfortunately today, much of the compute still happens at the center of the network or on the client device. This situation results in more traffic, higher latency, and less flexibility. Moving processing closer together—away from the two furthest points where it happens today, the network core and the client, toward the network edge and aggregation layers—can speed deployment and reduce TCO for carriers. In these environments, flexible general-purpose compute will drive the most value. If “data is the new currency”, then positioning compute should be like choosing an oil well site: as close to the resource as possible, yet comprehending the geographic transport issues.

**Building Agnostic, Standardized Infrastructures**
With investment and processing moving to the edge, how can carriers design the most flexible, innovative solutions? The key is to move away from the purpose-built platforms of the past and toward the more flexible, yet standard, agnostic solutions of the future. Because the cloud world is rapidly unfolding with new innovations every day, it is critical that carriers have the ability to leverage these innovations quickly to monetize them. While some believe the key is simply virtualization, in essence, the more critical element is the abstraction of the hardware layer. Moving the point of abstraction further up the stack unlocks more benefits to the carrier. Breaking the connection between the hardware and software stack allows for more flexibility. Software infrastructures like OpenStack and **OpenDataPlane** further distance the application from the underlying hardware. These open source API frameworks become the equalizer in the middle, bringing consistency to a wide range of applications and operating environments above, while enabling deployment on a wide range of hardware below.
