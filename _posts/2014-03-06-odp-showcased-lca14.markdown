This week the OpenDataPlane project was showcased at the Linaro Connect Asia conference in Macau, China.  In addition to a general project update session, sessions were held to provide a code walk through of an example ODP application as well as a roundtable to discuss early user experiences with using ODP.  This was followed by a technology demonstration showing applications running on ODP across a variety of platforms and processor architectures.

In the first demo, network traffic was passed between two ODP applications running on two different ARM-based SoC platforms while being snooped by an ODP-enhanced version of libpcap running on an x86 middlebox.  The snooped traffic was then forwarded to another x86 for display via Wireshark.


In the second demo, an ODP-enhanced version of OpenVPN was used to pass UDP traffic between an ARM-based Arndale processor and an x86 processor.


These demonstrations illustrated the cross-platform, cross-architecture goals of the ODP project: to provide a common API framework for use by data plane applications running across a variety of platforms and processor architectures.  Over the course of 2014 a number of additional ODP Reference implementations will be added covering more SoCs and architectures to further realize this goal, leading to a formal ODP Release 1.0 for later this year.
