The ODP team will demonstrate ODP Performance / Overhead with Full Isolation at Linaro Connect Asia 2015 in Hong Kong.

### Objective

Demonstrate the effects of preemption and system overhead on the performance of a CPU-intensive application, and show the performance advantage gained by running that application on an isolated, full tick-less CPU core.

### Description

The RT patchset has come to EoL and an alternative to meet the determinism and latency requirements for  networking workloads is required. Compare the two solutions and the impacts migrating to Core isolation may  impose.
