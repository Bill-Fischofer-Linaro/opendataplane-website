MAY 25, 2016:  Cavium sent us over a Gigabyte R120-T30 just about three weeks after the production scale 48-core ThunderX ARM processor began shipping. We are going to have a much more comprehensive view of performance over the next few weeks and we are seeing much better performance out of this system than we initially expected. In the meantime, we wanted to provide an overview of the platform we received. The impact of the platform cannot be understated. This is production silicon 48 core 64-bit ARMv8 that is the first direct competitor to the Intel Xeon E5-1600 and Xeon E5-2600 lines we have seen since AMD effectively exited the market. After spending a few weeks with the platform, we feel ready to publish an overview. The Cavium ThunderX is a very different approach to a server processor. While we will explore the performance of the 48-core Cavium ThunderX in a series of upcoming pieces, the Gigabyte R120-T30 1U server provides insights into some of the biggest selling points of the ThunderX platform.
