<blockquote markdown="1">
Kalray’s KONIC-80 will support the OpenDataPlane (ODP) framework, which is an open source Linaro hosted initiative that is building momentum in the telecom, networking and security industry. ODP provides a full set of APIs that allows users to easily port and customize software protocol stacks. In parallel, Kalray is working with software partners to offer a complete turnkey solution by porting on top of ODP functions such as Open vSwitch (OVS), MPLS, NVGRE, VXLAN, SSL, IPsec, and TCP along with iSCSI, iSER or NVMEoF.

**Product Highlights**

KONIC-80 is a single width, half-length PCIe programmable card that allows users to support new functionalities and protocols in a few weeks as opposed to almost one year with competition boards that are based on ASICs. It supports 2 x 40GbE ports and consumes maximum 35W.

At the heart of the smart NIC is Bostan, which is one of the few embedded processors capable of processing on the fly 2 x 40GbE full duplex line rate thanks to a fully deterministic and low latency architecture integrating 288 C/C++ programmable CPU cores and 128 crypto co-processors. Bostan can feed the internal processing array with 190 million packets per second (Mpps) and execute up to 3,300 instructions per packet at this rate. This is enough to perform extra functions such as compression or encryption in addition to basic L2-L7 routing.
