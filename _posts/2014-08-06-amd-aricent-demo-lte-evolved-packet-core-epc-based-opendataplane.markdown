[Aricent](http://www.aricent.com/) and [AMD](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB8QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amd.com%2F&ei=UiviU9zTNMPjoAS24oCoAw&usg=AFQjCNFVdhMlnWpDFHA4OYGHoxVx0Nefcw&sig2=dPW_OyZtFWjuQbXQ_wWj3w&bvm=bv.72197243,d.cGU) have successfully demonstrated LTE Evolved Packet Core (EPC) with the fast/data path of SGW/PGW nodes running inside a multi-core ARM® V8 Cortex®-A57 [64 bit] core. Aricent provided the software based on OpenDataPlane with linux-generic as the backend driver over Packet Socket interface, at the ARM Partners’ Meet (APM) in Cambridge in early August 2014.

The successful demonstration for an LTE end to end call was established and it entailed a streaming video between the mobile [UE] and the Packet Data Network [PDN].
