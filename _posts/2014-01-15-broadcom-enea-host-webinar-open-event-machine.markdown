### Open Event Machine-a Model for Best Data Plane Performance in Multicore Devices


This webinar, to be presented jointly by Enea and Broadcom on 16 January 2014, will introduce and explain the Open Event Machine model, market and use cases, and a Linux based implementation on the Broadcom XLP architecture. Additionally, there will be a brief discussion on the Linaro Networking Group (LNG) ODP initiative. ODP—Open Data Plane—is a cross-platform open API specification for high performance data plane processing in Linux user space. Event Machine is the starting baseline architecture of ODP. Enea and Broadcom are members of LNG and are actively promoting ODP development.
